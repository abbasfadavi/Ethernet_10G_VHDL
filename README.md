# Ethernet_10G_VHDL




## Description
This project is an implementation of Ethernet 10G using VHDL for Ultrascale series FPGA chips. Ethernet 10G is a high-speed communication standard for connecting devices to data networks, and this project is designed to create a Ultrascale-compatible Ethernet 10G module.

## Features

- Supports the Ethernet 10G standard
- Compatible with Ultrascale series FPGA chips
- Implemented using VHDL
- Comprehensive code documentation
